    <h1> What is a rabbit? </h1>
    <p>Rabbits are small, furry mammals known for their<em> long ears, </em>powerful hind legs for hopping, and short, fluffy tails, living in burrows and eating plants like grass and vegetables. These <strong> herbivorous creatures </strong> are naturally alert, with keen senses and nearly <strong> 360-degree vision </strong>, helping them avoid predators, and are social animals often living in colonies. From the wild ancestor of domestic breeds to beloved pets, rabbits are characterized by their rapid reproduction, unique digestive habits, and playful nature, making them <s>significant in both ecology and human culture.</s> <strong> Rabbits belong to the family Leporidae and are categorized into wild species and domestic breeds. </strong> Wild rabbits, such as the widely known Cottontails (Sylvilagus) and the ancestral European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), are typically adapted for survival in various habitats including grasslands, forests, and deserts. Domesticated rabbits, all of which descend from the European rabbit, are bred for various purposes, including as pets, show animals, or livestock. These breeds are highly diverse in size and appearance: they range from the tiny Netherland Dwarf, which weighs only a few pounds, to the Flemish Giant, which can be as large as a small dog. Popular pet breeds include the Holland Lop, known for its drooping ears and sweet temperament; the Mini Rex, prized for its plush, velvet-like fur; and the Lionhead, distinguished by its characteristic mane of long fur around its head. Whether wild or domestic, these animals are characterized by their herbivorous diets, long ears for detecting predators, and powerful hind legs for swift movement.  </p>
