    <h1> What is a rabbit? </h1>
    <p>Rabbits are small, furry mammals known for their<em> long ears, </em>powerful hind legs for hopping, and short, fluffy tails, living in burrows and eating plants like grass and vegetables. These <strong> herbivorous creatures </strong> are naturally alert, with keen senses and nearly <strong> 360-degree vision </strong>, helping them avoid predators, and are social animals often living in colonies. From the wild ancestor of domestic breeds to beloved pets, rabbits are characterized by their rapid reproduction, unique digestive habits, and playful nature, making them <acronym>significant in both ecology and human culture.</acronym> <strong> <br> Rabbits belong to the family Leporidae and are categorized into wild species and domestic breeds. </strong> Wild rabbits, such as the widely known Cottontails (Sylvilagus) and the ancestral European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), are typically adapted for survival in various habitats including grasslands, forests, and deserts. Domesticated rabbits, all of which descend from the European rabbit, are bred for various purposes, including as pets, show animals, or livestock. <br> These breeds are highly diverse in size and appearance: they range from the tiny Netherland Dwarf, which weighs only a few pounds, to the Flemish Giant, which can be as large as a small dog. Popular pet breeds include the Holland Lop, known for its drooping ears and sweet temperament; the Mini Rex, prized for its plush, velvet-like fur; and the Lionhead, distinguished by its characteristic mane of long fur around its head. <br>  Whether wild or domestic, these animals are characterized by their herbivorous diets, long ears for detecting predators, and powerful hind legs for swift movement.Rabbits are a paraphyletic grouping, and do not constitute a clade, as hares (belonging to the genus Lepus) are nested within the Leporidae clade and are not described as rabbits. Although once considered rodents, lagomorphs diverged earlier and have a number of traits rodents lack, including two extra incisors. Similarities between rabbits and rodents were once attributed to convergent evolution, but studies in molecular biology have found a common ancestor between lagomorphs and rodents and place them in the clade Glires.

Rabbit physiology is suited to escaping predators and surviving in various habitats, living either alone or in groups in nests or burrows. <br> As prey animals, rabbits are constantly aware of their surroundings, having a wide field of vision and ears with high surface area to detect potential predators. The ears of a rabbit are essential for thermoregulation and contain a high density of blood vessels. The bone structure of a rabbit's hind legs, which is longer than that of the fore legs, allows for quick hopping, which is beneficial for escaping predators and can provide powerful kicks if captured. Rabbits are typically nocturnal and often sleep with their eyes open. They reproduce quickly, having short pregnancies, large litters of four to twelve kits, and no particular mating season; however, the mortality rate of rabbit embryos is high, and there exist several widespread diseases that affect rabbits, such as rabbit hemorrhagic disease and myxomatosis. In some regions, especially Australia, rabbits have caused ecological problems and are regarded as a pest.  </p>
