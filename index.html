    <h1> What is a rabbit? </h1>
    <p>Rabbits are small, furry mammals known for their<em> long ears, </em>powerful hind legs for hopping, and short, fluffy tails, living in burrows and eating plants like grass and vegetables. These <strong> herbivorous creatures </strong> are naturally alert, with keen senses and nearly <strong> 360-degree vision </strong>, helping them avoid predators, and are social animals often living in colonies. From the wild ancestor of domestic breeds to beloved pets, rabbits are characterized by their rapid reproduction, unique digestive habits, and playful nature, making them significant in both ecology and human culture.  </p>
