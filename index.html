    <h1> What is a piano? </h1>
    <p>A piano is a large keyboard instrument with <strong> 88 black and white keys</strong> that, when pressed, trigger hammers to strike strings, producing sound; its name comes from <em>"pianoforte</em>," meaning "soft-loud," because its volume can vary from soft to loud depending on key pressure, making it incredibly versatile for many musical genres. Invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori around 1700, it features a cast-iron frame, strings, a soundboard for amplification, and pedals for tonal effects, evolving into grand and upright forms</p>
